# Worldcup-database-for-freecodecamp-
Database project for freecodecamp 
In this project, a database is been created and bash is been used, and various queries are performed on the same data.
There are three files: worldcup.sql, insert_data.sh, and queries.sh. The worldcup.sql file contains a database with tables named 'games' and 'teams', which hold records of year, round, winner, opponent, winner_goals, and opponent_goals from the games.csv file. The insert_data.sh script inserts data from games.csv into the tables using a bash script. The queries.sh file contains SQL queries based on the data obtained from the insert_data.sh file.
